### Core Script Architecture

**GameManager.cs** - Central game state controller

```csharp
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Game Settings")]
    public int totalLevels = 3;
    public float gameTime = 180f;

    [Header("UI References")]
    public HUDController hudController;

    public static GameManager Instance;

    private int currentScore = 0;
    private int currentLevel = 1;
    private float remainingTime;
    private bool gameActive = true;

    // Singleton pattern, score management, level progression
}
```

**Player2DController.cs** - Complete 2D character controller

```csharp
public class Player2DController : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Movement")]
    public float moveSpeed = 6f;
    public float jumpForce = 12f;
    public float coyoteTime = 0.2f;

    [Header("Health System")]
    public int maxHealth = 3;
    private int currentHealth;

    // Modern 2D movement with all features from Lesson 4
    // Health system, damage handling, respawn logic
}
```

**AudioManager.cs** - Centralized audio control

```csharp
public class AudioManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Audio Sources")]
    public AudioSource musicSource;
    public AudioSource sfxSource;

    public static AudioManager Instance;

    // Background music management
    // Sound effect playback with pooling
    // Volume settings persistence
}
```

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Scope Management

**Problem**: Adding too many features before core gameplay works
**Solution**:

- Focus on minimum viable product first
- Add features only after core systems are stable
- Keep a feature priority list and stick to it

### Challenge 2: 2D Physics Debugging

**Problem**: Unexpected collision behavior, objects falling through floors
**Solution**:

- Use proper collider sizes and positioning
- Check Rigidbody2D settings (especially Collision Detection mode)
- Verify layer collision matrix settings
- Use Physics2D.OverlapCircle for reliable ground detection

### Challenge 3: Performance Optimization

**Problem**: Frame rate drops with many objects or effects
**Solution**:

- Implement object pooling for frequently spawned objects
- Optimize sprite textures and use appropriate compression
- Limit particle system emission rates
- Use Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks

### Challenge 4: UI Scaling Issues

**Problem**: Interface elements don't scale properly across devices
**Solution**:

- Use Canvas Scaler with "Scale With Screen Size"
- Set reference resolution to target aspect ratio
- Use anchoring and flexible layouts
- Test on different resolution settings

### Challenge 5: Audio Management

**Problem**: Overlapping sounds, audio lag, or volume balancing
**Solution**:

- Use Audio Mixer for centralized volume control
- Implement audio pooling for frequent sound effects
- Compress audio appropriately (OGG Vorbis recommended)
- Set proper Audio Source settings (2D/3D, rolloff)

## Success Tips and Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Start Simple**: Build core mechanics before adding complexity
2. **Test Early and Often**: Playtest every major addition
3. **Version Control**: Save incremental project versions
4. **Comment Code**: Make it readable for future you and others
5. **Plan UI Early**: Design interface mockups before implementation

### Time Management

1. **Set Daily Goals**: Break project into achievable daily tasks
2. **Buffer Time**: Leave 25% extra time for unexpected issues
3. **Prioritize Features**: Core gameplay before nice-to-have features
4. **Regular Builds**: Test executable builds throughout development

### Quality Assurance

1. **Player Testing**: Have others test your game regularly
2. **Edge Case Testing**: Try to break your own game
3. **Platform Testing**: Test builds on different computers
4. **Accessibility**: Consider colorblind-friendly design choices

### Code Organization

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each script should have one main purpose
2. **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, descriptive variable/method names
3. **Error Handling**: Add null checks and boundary validation
4. **Documentation**: Include header comments explaining script purpose
