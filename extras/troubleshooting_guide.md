## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Project Setup Issues**

#### Issue: Unity Hub won't open or crashes
**Symptoms**: Unity Hub doesn't launch, shows error messages
**Solutions**:
- Restart your computer
- Update Unity Hub to latest version
- Check system requirements (Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+)
- Run as administrator (Windows)

#### Issue: Can't create new project
**Symptoms**: "Create project" button grayed out, project creation fails
**Solutions**:
- Check available disk space (need 25GB+)
- Verify Unity LTS version is installed
- Try different project location
- Restart Unity Hub

#### Issue: Project opens but shows errors
**Symptoms**: Red error messages in Console, missing components
**Solutions**:
- Check Unity version compatibility
- Reimport all assets: `Assets â†’ Reimport All`
- Delete Library folder and reopen project
- Verify all required packages are installed

---

### **Script Compilation Issues**

#### Issue: Scripts won't compile
**Symptoms**: Red error messages, scripts show syntax errors
**Solutions**:
- Check C# syntax (missing semicolons, brackets)
- Verify script names match class names
- Check for typos in variable names
- Ensure scripts are in correct folder structure

#### Issue: "Script not found" errors
**Symptoms**: Missing script components, broken references
**Solutions**:
- Reattach scripts to GameObjects
- Check script file names match class names
- Verify scripts are in Assets folder
- Reimport scripts: Right-click â†’ Reimport

#### Issue: Input System errors
**Symptoms**: "Input System not found" or binding errors
**Solutions**:
- Install Input System package: `Window â†’ Package Manager â†’ Input System`
- Regenerate Input Actions: Right-click â†’ Regenerate C# Class
- Check Input Action asset is assigned to PlayerInput component

---

### **Scene and Build Issues**

#### Issue: Objects not visible in Game view
**Symptoms**: Scene view shows objects but Game view is empty
**Solutions**:
- Check camera position (Z should be negative for 2D)
- Verify camera is set to Orthographic
- Check object positions (Z should be 0 for 2D sprites)
- Ensure objects are within camera view

#### Issue: Scene switching doesn't work
**Symptoms**: SceneManager.LoadScene() fails, scenes don't load
**Solutions**:
- Add scenes to Build Settings: `File â†’ Build Settings â†’ Add Open Scenes`
- Check scene names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify scenes are saved before building
- Use SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync() for large scenes

#### Issue: Build fails or won't run
**Symptoms**: Build process fails, executable won't start
**Solutions**:
- Check Build Settings configuration
- Verify target platform is correct
- Check for compilation errors before building
- Try building to different location

---

### **Physics and Animation Issues**

#### Issue: Physics not working correctly
**Symptoms**: Objects don't fall, collisions don't detect
**Solutions**:
- Check Rigidbody2D is attached
- Verify colliders are not triggers
- Check physics layers and collision matrix
- Ensure FixedUpdate() is used for physics code

#### Issue: Animations not playing
**Symptoms**: Animator shows states but no animation
**Solutions**:
- Check Animator Controller is assigned
- Verify animation clips are assigned to states
- Check transition conditions are met
- Ensure Animator component is enabled

#### Issue: Animation events not firing
**Symptoms**: Animation plays but events don't trigger
**Solutions**:
- Check event methods are public
- Verify event names match exactly
- Ensure events are placed on animation timeline
- Check method signatures match event parameters

---

### **UI and Input Issues**

#### Issue: UI not responding to input
**Symptoms**: Buttons don't click, UI elements not interactive
**Solutions**:
- Check EventSystem is in scene
- Verify UI elements have GraphicRaycaster
- Check Canvas is set to Screen Space - Overlay
- Ensure UI elements are not behind other objects

#### Issue: Input not working
**Symptoms**: Keyboard/gamepad input not detected
**Solutions**:
- Check Input Actions are properly configured
- Verify PlayerInput component is attached
- Check input bindings are correct
- Ensure Input System package is installed

#### Issue: Camera follow is jittery
**Symptoms**: Camera stutters when following player
**Solutions**:
- Use LateUpdate() for camera movement
- Add smoothing with Vector3.Lerp()
- Check if player movement is in FixedUpdate()
- Use Cinemachine for professional camera control

---

### **Performance Issues**

#### Issue: Game runs slowly
**Symptoms**: Low FPS, stuttering, lag
**Solutions**:
- Check Unity Profiler for bottlenecks
- Reduce draw calls by using Sprite Atlas
- Optimize physics timestep
- Use object pooling for frequently created objects

#### Issue: Memory usage is high
**Symptoms**: Game uses too much RAM
**Solutions**:
- Check for memory leaks in scripts
- Use Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets()
- Avoid creating objects in Update()
- Use object pooling instead of Instantiate/Destroy

## ðŸ”§ Debugging Tools

### **Console Window**
- **Window â†’ General â†’ Console**
- Shows errors, warnings, and Debug.Log messages
- Click on error messages to jump to problematic code
- Clear console: Right-click â†’ Clear

### **Unity Profiler**
- **Window â†’ Analysis â†’ Profiler**
- Shows performance metrics in real-time
- Identifies CPU, GPU, and memory bottlenecks
- Essential for optimization

### **Scene View Debugging**
- **Gizmos**: Visualize colliders, triggers, and custom shapes
- **Wireframe Mode**: See object wireframes
- **Overdraw Mode**: Check for overdraw issues

### **Debug.Log() Usage**
```csharp
// Basic logging
Debug.Log("Player position: " + transform.position);

// Conditional logging
Debug.LogWarning("Health is low: " + health);

// Error logging
Debug.LogError("Failed to load scene: " + sceneName);

// Format strings
Debug.LogFormat("Player {0} has {1} health", playerName, health);
```
