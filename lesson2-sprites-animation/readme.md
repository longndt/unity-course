# Lesson 2: Sprites & Animation

## Overview

**Difficulty**: Beginner â†’ Intermediate
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1 completed, Basic C# programming

Learn the 2D asset pipeline, sprite rendering, sorting layers, and build an Animator Controller with parameters, transitions, and animation events.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- Import sprites correctly and configure slicing/pixels per unit
- Use `SpriteRenderer`, sorting layers, and order in layer
- Create `AnimatorController`, states, parameters, and transitions
- Trigger animation events and handle them in scripts
- Flip character and manage directional animations

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. In your Unity project, create a new scene `Lesson2-Animation`
2. Add a character GameObject with `SpriteRenderer`
3. Create an Animator Controller and assign to the character
4. Add scripts from `example/`: `AnimatorControl.cs`, `SpriteControl.cs`, `AnimationDebugger.cs`, `Character2D.cs`
5. Configure parameters (e.g., `Speed`, `IsGrounded`) and transitions; press Play

## ðŸ“š Learning Path

- Reference â†’ `reference/` (Animator, SpriteRenderer)
- Example â†’ `example/` (run and inspect state machine)
- Theory â†’ `theory/theory2.md`
- Lab â†’ `lab/lab2-instructions.md`

## âœ… What's Next

Proceed to [Lesson 3: Physics & Collision](../lesson3-physics-collision/) to learn about 2D physics and collision detection.

---

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

- **Study Examples**: Start with `example/` folder to understand concepts
- **Practice Labs**: Complete exercises in `lab/` folder
- **Explore Sample Project**: Check out `sample-projects/lesson2-sprites-animation/` for complete implementation
- **Build Your Own**: Create your own animated character
