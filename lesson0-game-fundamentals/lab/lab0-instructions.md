## ðŸŽ¯ Lab Tasks

### Task 1: Web/Mobile vs Game Development Analysis

#### **1.1 Compare Development Patterns**

**Think about a web app you've built (e.g., todo list, blog):**
- How does it handle user interaction?
- What happens when a user clicks a button?
- How does it manage state and data?

**Think about a mobile app you've used (e.g., social media, productivity):**
- How does it respond to touch gestures?
- What happens when you switch between screens?
- How does it handle background/foreground states?

**Compare with a game you've played (e.g., platformer, puzzle):**
- How does the game respond to your input?
- What happens continuously while you play?
- How does the game world change over time?

#### **1.2 Document Key Differences**

Create a comparison chart in a text file:

```
Web Development:
- Event-driven: User clicks â†’ something happens â†’ done
- State management: Data changes drive UI updates
- Request/Response: Server communication patterns
- UI-centric: Interface is the primary concern

Mobile Development:
- App lifecycle: Activities manage screens
- Touch events: Gesture-based interactions
- Platform-specific: Android/iOS differences
- Resource management: Memory and battery optimization

Game Development:
- Real-time simulation: Game runs continuously at 60+ FPS
- Physics-driven: Objects move and interact realistically
- Player control: Player directly controls what happens
- Immersive experience: Full attention and engagement
```

#### **1.3 Identify Transferable Concepts**

**What concepts transfer between platforms?**
- Object-oriented programming
- Event handling
- State management
- User interface design
- Performance optimization

**What's unique to game development?**
- Real-time simulation
- Physics simulation
- Continuous input processing
- Frame-rate dependent logic
