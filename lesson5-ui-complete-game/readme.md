# Lesson 5: UI, Gameplay Loop & Build

## Overview

**Difficulty**: Intermediate â†’ Advanced
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 4 completed

Build a vertical slice including menus, HUD, pause/state management, simple save/load, and prepare builds for target platforms.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- Create menus (main/pause/results) and HUD (health, score)
- Manage gameplay states and pause/resume flow
- Wire basic save/load (PlayerPrefs or JSON)
- Prepare platform-specific build profiles and test builds
- Profile runtime performance and iterate

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Create scenes: `MainMenu`, `Game`, `Results`
2. Add scripts from `code/`: `MenuManager.cs`, `MainMenuPanel.cs`, `HUDManager.cs`, `UIPanel.cs`, `UIButton.cs`, `UISlider.cs`, `UIText.cs`, `SpecializedButtons.cs`, `HealthBar.cs`
3. Implement pause (time scale), scene transitions, and basic save/load
4. Build for Windows/macOS; test runtime behavior

> Note: `code/` will be migrated to `example/` later.

- Reference â†’ `reference/` (UI components, state machine checklist) [to be added]
- Example â†’ `code/` (run full loop and verify UI states)
- Theory â†’ `theory/theory5.md`
- Lab â†’ `lab/lab5-instructions.md`
