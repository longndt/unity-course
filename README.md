## üìÅ Lesson Structure

Each lesson follows a standardized structure designed for effective learning:

```
lesson-topic/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  reference/          # Quick reference codes & checklists
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  example/            # Working code examples
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ  theory/             # Light documentation (single theoryX.md)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ  lab/                # Hands-on playtest tasks
```

Note: All lesson folders now use the standardized `example/` structure.

## üìö How to Study This Course Effectively

### Step 1: Start with Reference
- Skim `reference/` to see APIs and checklists used in the lesson

### Step 2: Explore Working Example
- Open the lesson `example/` and run the sample scene
- Playtest first, then peek into scripts structure

### Step 3: Read Theory as Reference
- Read only the sections related to what you're implementing
- Jump between theory ‚Üî example ‚Üî reference

### Step 4: Code Along
- Recreate the example features in your own scene
- Test frequently and iterate in small steps

### Step 5: Complete Lab
- Follow playtest criteria to validate features (measurable outcomes)

### Step 6: Review & Reflect
- Compare with example, note pitfalls, create personal cheat sheets

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Check and Install Development Environment
- Read `extras/environment-setup.md` for Unity Hub, Unity 6 LTS, IDE, Git

### Step 2: Open the Project
- Open this folder in Unity Hub and launch with Unity 6 LTS

### Step 3: Recommended Learning Path
- Lesson 0 ‚Üí Lesson 1 ‚Üí Lesson 2 ‚Üí Lesson 3 ‚Üí Lesson 4 ‚Üí Lesson 5

## üí° Learning Tips

- Playtest early and often; optimize later
- Use `reference/` for API patterns; keep theory light
- Prefer `FixedUpdate` for physics, `Update` for input sampling
- Profile builds on the target device before shipping
