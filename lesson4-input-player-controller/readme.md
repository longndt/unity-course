# Lesson 4: Input & Player Controller

## Overview

**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 3 completed, Basic C# programming

Use the new Input System to build a responsive 2D controller with keyboard and gamepad support, and integrate a basic follow camera.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- Configure Input Actions, bindings, and `PlayerInput`
- Compare event-based vs polling input patterns
- Implement move/jump/dash with input buffering
- Integrate camera follow (Cinemachine optional)
- Respect UI focus and disable gameplay input when menus are open

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Create a scene `Lesson4-Input`
2. Create an `Input Actions` asset and generate C# class
3. Add scripts from `example/`: `PlayerInputController.cs`, `Player2DController.cs`, `AutoInputEvents.cs`, `InputSystemComparison.cs`
4. Wire `PlayerInput` to your character; press Play and test with keyboard/gamepad
