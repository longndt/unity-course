# Lesson 3: Physics & Collisions

## Overview

**Difficulty**: Intermediate
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 2 completed, Basic C# programming

Master Rigidbody2D, colliders, physics materials, layers, and callbacks. Implement platformer jumping with coyote time and variable jump height.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- Configure `Rigidbody2D` and colliders for stable physics
- Understand `FixedUpdate` vs `Update`, time step, and interpolation
- Use collision layers/masks and raycasts responsibly
- Implement jump mechanics and ground checks
- Differentiate triggers vs collisions and handle callbacks

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Create a scene `Lesson3-Physics`
2. Add player with `Rigidbody2D` + collider; add ground colliders
3. Add scripts from `example/`: `RigidbodyControl.cs`, `ColliderSetup.cs`, `PhysicsMaterialSetup.cs`, `PlayerJump.cs`, `AdvancedJump.cs`, `TriggerDetection.cs`, `ForceControl.cs`
4. Tune gravity, drag, material bounciness; test jump behavior

## ðŸ“š Learning Path

- Reference â†’ `reference/` (physics checklist)
- Example â†’ `example/` (playtest and tune values)
- Theory â†’ `theory/theory3.md`
- Lab â†’ `lab/lab3-instructions.md`
